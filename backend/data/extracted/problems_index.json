      "question": "A car moves with a constant velocity of 20 m/s. How far does it travel in 5 seconds?",
      "solution": "Using distance = velocity × time: d = 20 m/s × 5 s = 100 m",
      "hints": [
        "Use the formula: distance = velocity × time",
        "Make sure units are consistent"
      ],
      "answer": "100 m",

      "question": "A block of mass 5 kg is pushed with a force of 20 N. If there is no friction, what is the acceleration?",
      "solution": "Using Newton's second law F = ma: a = F/m = 20 N / 5 kg = 4 m/s²",
      "hints": [
        "Use Newton's second law: F = ma",
        "Rearrange to find acceleration: a = F/m"
      ],
      "answer": "4 m/s²",

      "question": "A ball of mass 0.5 kg is thrown upward with an initial velocity of 10 m/s. What is its initial kinetic energy? (g = 10 m/s²)",
      "solution": "Using KE = (1/2)mv²: KE = 0.5 × 0.5 kg × (10 m/s)² = 25 J",
      "hints": [
        "Use the kinetic energy formula: KE = (1/2)mv²",
        "Square the velocity before multiplying"
      ],
